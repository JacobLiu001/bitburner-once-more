 * but we don't want to retry too much. We also don't want to be too noisy if we fail to find the element.
 * In other cases, we always expect to find the element we're looking for, and if we don't it's an error.
 * @param {NS} ns
 * @param {string} xpath The xpath 1.0 expression to use to find the element.
 * @param {boolean} expectFailure Changes the behaviour when an item cannot be found.
